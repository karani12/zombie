# zombie
Well as i said C# is great. I love it. Its environment, how they set your project up on Visual studio. 

### windows form manipulation

This was the aim of the project
- Using the drawing of bullets
- Be able to shoot
- Move a player around
- Set timers
- set a healthbar

## what i learnt:

- How to use the basics of c# that is conditional statements, operations
- Window form manipulation
- building for production
- Yes where to look for C# resources on the internet because i googled alot
- data structures n C# mainly used lists

## How the game works:
- Main player i.e image
- Four zombies that are generated randomly as soon as one is killed. the zombies work in such a way that they constantly follow the movement of the player
- Player intersects with the zombies, the health is reduced.
- bullets are ten and an ammo addition that needs to be picked when they are all used
- Timer for 20s 

I was not aiming for game development but being able to use C# in a logical way and be able to perform operations depending on conditions
